{: .prompt-info }

I value the open exchange of ideas and discussions that fuel a thriving internet. However, I believe that third parties should not misuse public content simply because it is publicly available.

Licensing arrangements enable me to:

- Understand who is accessing my public content and for what purposes.
- Place contractual restrictions to prevent misuse and safeguard my intellectual property.

If you're looking to reprint, republish, or reuse my content, this page provides guidelines for circumstances when you may not need to contact me directly for a license and how to get in touch when your use **does** require a license.
